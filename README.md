# Amaury Simondet - Vanilla MERN Authentication App

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I have made what we call a MERN app for MongoDB Express React and Node ! 

This is a "vanilla" project (no design) but all the hard stuff has been made:
- Back end : 
  - Connection to a Mongo database and schemas
  - Creation of an API to send and receive from React to Node
 
- API :
  - Signup, Login, Logout functions using passport
  - Signup / Login with facebook and google using passport
  - Tokens management  

- Front end:
  - Basic Login and Signup React components with forms using bootstrap
  - Only authenticated accessible page with a Logout button
  - Routing and private routing

## Make it work for you
- Download zip, extract anywhere then cd in it
- Create a .env file and put your mongoURL, hashing secret, id and secret of facebook and google apps in it like this:

`
secret=Example
mongoURL=mongodb+srv://exampleuser:examplepassword@cluster0.naapg7h.mongodb.net/exampleDB
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=somenumbersandstuff
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=somenumbersandstuff
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=somenumbersandstuff
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=somenumbersandstuff
`
- Back in cmd: `npm config set legacy-peer-deps true`
- `npm install`
- cd in client
- `npm install` too

You are all set now:
- `npm start` in the root directory (to run the server, API and mongo connection)
- `npm start` in the client directory (for the front end)
